# Matter Open IoT SDK All-Clusters-App Example Application

## Build and run

For information on how to build and run this example and further information
about the platform it is run on see
[Open IoT SDK examples](../../../docs/examples/openiotsdk_examples.md).

The example name to use in the scripts is `all-clusters-app`.

## Using the example

Communication with the application goes through the active telnet session. When
the application runs these lines should be visible:

```
[INF] [-] Open IoT SDK all-clusters-app example application start
...
[INF] [-] Open IoT SDK all-clusters-app example application run
```

The all-clusters-app application launched correctly and you can follow traces in
the terminal.

### Commissioning

Read the
[Open IoT SDK commissioning guide](../../../docs/guides/openiotsdk_commissioning.md)
to see how to use the Matter controller to commission and control the
application.
